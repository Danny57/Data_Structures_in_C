/*********************************************************/
Final Project: COP 4338 

This project includes a collection of different data structures.
Each data structure library is contained within a seperate folder.
The data structure folder has a header file and tester file in 
order to show the user how the function work. The code can be 
compiled on command line using:
gcc -std=c99 -Wall dataStructure.c main.c -o dataStructure.

Each data structure uses generic void pointers to allow 
a wide range of values to be stored in the data structures.
The user is required to handle the memory allocation and deallocation 
of the dat values he or she has chosen. Also the user must implement 
ther own compare function that meets the signature provided. This allows
the user to create their own structs and use them within the data 
structures.
